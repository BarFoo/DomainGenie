# Domain Genie

Free and open source desktop app for domain portfolio management.

This is a very early project, more info will be coming soon.

## Warning

If you're using this very early version, please note the following. 

Your registrar API keys are stored locally and are encrypted using aes-256, with a password you specify when launching the app for the first time.

At this moment in time your domains are NOT encrypted but again are only stored on your local machine. 

If you do not agree with this, please DO NOT use this software.

I will explore options for encrypting domain domain data without impacting performance.
